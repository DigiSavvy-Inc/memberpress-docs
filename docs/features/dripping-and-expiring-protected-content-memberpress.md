# Dripping and Expiring Protected Content

Covered on this page:

## Video Overview

This video explains how to drip content in MemberPress:

Dripping content is the process of releasing your protected content to your users in batches, or at different times, compared to all at once.

Expiring content is the process of expiring access to protected content so that even paying subscribers can no longer see it.

Note: these two features are independent, meaning you don't have to use one to use the other.

MemberPress rules allow you to drip and expire content with this simple feature found in each of your rules:

Note: If you would like to drip and/or expire content to a membership(s) on your site with a rule that has a drip and/or expiration feature as outlined below AND have the content available to another membership(s) immediately (no drip) and/or never expire (no expiration), then simply create another rule for that same content for the other membership(s) and make sure it has no drip and/or expiration feature to it.

## Using the Drip Feature

### Dripping Whole Pages, Posts, etc.

The MemberPress Drip feature can be set with any MemberPress rule. This means you can drip any content (pages, posts, courses, etc.) you can protect using MemberPress rules.

Here are the basic steps to set up a drip feature on a rule:

Here is an outline of the Drip trigger options, from left to right:

#### Dripping MemberPress Courses

You can drip MemberPress courses like any other content on your website using MemberPress rules.

In addition, courses have a built-in course dripping feature, which you can use independently or combined with MemberPress rule dripping.

To combine the built-in and rule dripping, it's important to mention some rules to avoid possible conflicts.

Back to the top

### Sequence Dripping

MemberPress does not currently have a feature that allows you to set one rule or one drip setting, that will control more than one piece of content at a time.

This is because each unique drip feature must be a part of a unique rule.

So, for example, if you have two protected pages on your site, and you want page 1 to be dripped two weeks after a membership is purchased, and page 2 to be dripped three weeks after the same membership is purchased, you will need two separate rules to do that.

Finally, if you want to create a page, that will provide dripped links to your dripped content, please see the following subsection.

Back to the top

### Dripping Partial content

On your site, you may want to drip certain sections of a page, post, or custom post type. This done by simply creating a partial content rule in MemberPress that has a drip feature.

Remember, MemberPress rules allow you to set up only one unique drip feature per rule. So, for each unique dripping trigger, you will need to create a unique and separate partial content rule.

Using a partial content rule to drip

After you have created the partial content rule and set your desired drip trigger, you can use our simple shortcodes to wrap the content you would like to drip. Our shortcodes to accomplish this can be revealed by clicking the ‘Partial Content Codes' button on the rule's edit page:

MemberPress also makes it easy for you to add a custom message in place of the hidden content if you would like to do that. You will just need to use variations of the following shortcode (as outlined here):

```
[mepr-active]
```

Here is a simple example of the shortcode in action:

```
Only paying subscribers to our Gold Membership have access to this document after the first week of their subscription. Please return after having your subscription for a week or <a href='https://mytestsite.com/register/gold'>purchase that membership</a> to view.
```

You can see this shortcode added to a page using editor:

### Dripping menu items

If you would like to drip your menu items, then create a rule with a drip feature and then follow the instructions found on this page.

Please note in following those instructions, that if your menu item is linking to a specific page, post, etc. that is being protected by a MemberPress rule, you should use that rule's custom ID. Otherwise, you should use a partial content rule that has the desired drip trigger.

Back to the top

### Notifying Users of Dripped Content

MemberPress does not currently have an email feature that will trigger an email to be sent to the user at the same time dripped content becomes available.

However, many of our email marketing add-ons do allow for what we will call an Automation Workflow. If you are wondering if your selected email marketing add-on supports this type of feature, please contact their support directly.

For example, MailChimp allows you to set up what they call an  Automation or also an Automation Workflow. With MailChimp Automation, you can set the first trigger to be when the user signs up, or when they are added to your list (please contact MailChimp support directly if you need help doing this).

With our MailChimp integration, MemberPress can add the user to the list when they subscribe to a specific membership or any on your site.

Thus, you can have emails sent to users when dripped content is dripped. Simply be sure to have our MailChimp integration properly set up, your Automation Workflow created in MailChimp for your linked list in MemberPress, and your drip triggers added to your rules.

So to review, simply set up the Automation Workflow to correspond with your drip trigger in MemberPress. If you have a MemberPress drip trigger to drip content one week after a user subscribes to membership on your site, you will also want MailChimp to trigger an email one week after the user signups to your list (again, this will be done based on your  MailChimp integration setup).

### Adjusting a User Drip Position

From time to time, you may need to put a user further ahead in the drip sequence than they are currently at.

Drips are handled differently based on what triggers you use.

Fixed Date

If you've set your Drips to be based on a fixed date, then it will not be possible to fast-forward a user in the drips.

After Member Registers

If you drip based on the user's registration date (for the website, not any specific membership). Then the only way to fast-forward them in a drip is to modify their WordPress user_registered value in the wp_users database table. Or use a plugin like this to alter it.

After Member purchases “Membership”or After Member purchases any product for this rule

If you're dripping based off of the date the user signed up for a Membership. Then in most cases, you can fast-forward that user's drip status by modifying the “created at” date on their first transaction for that Membership.

Note: The only time editing the created_at date doesn't work, is if the user had a free trial period before their recurring payments began.

Back to the top

## Using the Expiration Feature

If you would like to expire access to content on your site (like for a limited-time offer) you can use your rule's expiration feature. Please note that the expiration applies to your paid subscribers. So, if your rule reaches its expiration date, then the content associated with that rule will not be available to the users of the membership(s) connected to the rule.

Now, because the way you use an expiration feature and its settings is the same as a drip feature, we will avoid being redundant here and ask that you please see the sections above for the drip feature to use your expiration feature.

For example, if you want to expire partial content on your site, you will set the expiration feature and do the same items explained in the Using a partial content rule to drip subsection above.
